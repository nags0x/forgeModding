<h1 align="center">Big Ass Dino 🦖</h1>

A chaotic Minecraft mod that brings loud, fast, and aggressive dinos into your world — because vanilla mobs are too polite.  
Built with love (and caffeine) for a fun Minecraft modding challenge.

## 🚨 Why This Dino Exists
Because Minecraft needed something more intense than creepers.  
We wanted to create a fast, enraged, knockback-happy beast that could chase players like a heat-seeking missile — and we did.  
Roaring, stomping, kicking dinos that turn Minecraft into a survival horror moment.

## 🔥 Feature List

- **Randomized dino spawning** across the Overworld 🌍
- **Custom sound effects** (roars borrowed from the Ender Dragon 🔊)
- **Roars every 10s** to slow nearby players (movement debuff)
- **Becomes enraged** when hit → gains speed + rage particles
- **Melee attack goal** + aggressive targeting (follows you across the land)
- **Knocks back players** if within 4 blocks (like a raging bull)
- **Ambient, hurt, and death sounds** (because vibes)
- **Animation system ready** (idle animations coming soon)
- **Attribute system configured**: HP, damage, speed
- **Correct spawn placements** (ON_GROUND logic)

> TL;DR: Dino exists. It’s loud. It’s fast. It’s beautiful. Minecraft just went Jurassic. 🌋
